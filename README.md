# Introduction

- A very simple ChatBot which the only functionality is to repeat your input.

## Scope of functionality

### index.html

- Barebone(2 stylesheets, 2 JS files connected)
- All fields pre-specified, are later modified in script.js

#### style.css

- Extremely simple CSS mainly for the chatbox of the chatbot.

### script.js

- Everything is in a callback(local) function, breaks down to 1 main function(generate_message)
- generate_message "generates" the HTML for the "smart" response of the chatbot.
